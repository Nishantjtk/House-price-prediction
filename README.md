Project Overview
The project aims to predict the sale price of houses based on various features. This is achieved by applying a Linear Regression model after preparing the data through cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features. We will evaluate the model using standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Dataset Description
The dataset contains several features such as:

Numerical Features: Square footage, number of rooms, year built, etc.
Categorical Features: House type, neighborhood, garage type, etc.
Target: SalePrice (the price of the house)
